# Web Bluetooth Community Group Charter

* This Charter: TBD
* Previous Charter: None
* Start Date: 2015-??-??

## Goals

Allow websites to communicate with devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way.
In particular the Web Bluetooth API will focus on
minimizing the device attack surface exposed to malicious websites,
possibly by removing access to
some existing Bluetooth features that are hard to implement securely.
Further, the API will anticipate a user interface to
select and approve access to devices as opposed to assuming certification and installation.

## Scope of Work

{TBD: Describe topics that are in scope.
For specifications that the CLA patent section applies to,
it is helpful to describe the scope in a way that it is clear
what types of technologies will be defined in specifications,
as opposed to adoption by reference or underlying technology not defined in the proposed spec.
Key use cases are often helpful in describing scope.
If no specifications will be defined in the group that the CLA patent section applies to,
the charter should clearly state that.
A clear scope is particularly important where patent licensing obligations may apply.}

### Out of Scope

{TBD: Identify topics known in advance to be out of scope}

## Deliverables

{TBD: Provide a brief description of each specification the group plans to produce.
Where an estimate is possible, it can be useful to provide an estimated schedule for key deliverables.
As described below, the group may later modify the charter deliverables. }

### Community Group Reports that are Specifications

{TBD: Provide a brief description of each Community Group Report the group plans to publish.
The description should be enough for those considering participation to know
the general types of technologies that will be defined in the report.}

### Community Group Reports that are not Specifications {TBD: Include only as necessary}

{TBD: Describe Community Group Reports that are not Specifications (e.g,. primers).}
The group MAY produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of this charter
but that are not Specifications covered by the CLA.

### Test Suites and Other Software {TBD: Include only as necessary}

{TBD: State whether test suites or any other software will be created for any Specifications.
For information about contributions to W3C test suites, please see Test the Web Forward,
and take note of W3C's test suite contribution policy and licenses for W3C test suites.
For other software contributions, clearly state which licenses will govern contributions and distribution.}

## Dependencies or Liaisons

{TBD: List any significant dependencies on other groups (inside or outside W3C) or materials. }

## Community and Business Group Process

Terms of in this charter that conflict with those of the Community and Business Group Process are void.

### Work Limited to Charter Scope

The group will not publish Community Group Reports that are
Specifications on topics other than those listed under "Community Group Reports that are Specifications" above.
See below for how to modify the charter.
The CLA applies to these Community Group Reports.

### Contribution Mechanics

For these Reports, Community Group participants agree to send contributions to
either the group "contrib" list or to the general group list, with subject line starting "[short-name-for spec]".
When meeting discussion includes contributions,
contributors are expected to record those contributions explicitly on the mailing list as described.

### Chair Selection

Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and
can replace their Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer.
However, if 5 participants—no two from the same organization—call for an election,
the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s) with a new Chair,
consulting the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777).

1. Participants announce their candidacies.
   Participants have 14 days to announce their candidacies,
   but this period ends as soon as all participants have announced their intentions.
   If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the Chair.
   If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote.
   Otherwise, nothing changes.
1. Participants vote.
   Participants have 21 days to vote for a single candidate,
   but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
   The individual who receives the most votes—no two from the same organization—is elected chair.
   In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to break the tie.
   An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.

Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the Community Development Lead to intervene.
The Community Development Lead, after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.

### Decision Process

{TBD: If you do not use the decision process from the template and if your decision process is not consensus-based,
it is important to indicate that clearly, and to describe the decision process you will use.}

This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus.
When the group discusses an issue on the mailing list and there is a call from the group for assessing consensus,
after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any objections.
Participants may call for an online vote if
they feel the Chair has not accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair refuses to assess consensus.
The call for a vote must specify the duration of the vote
which must be at least 7 days and should be no more than 14 days.
The Chair must start the vote within 7 days of the request.
The decision will be based on the majority of the ballots cast.
It is the Chair's responsibility to ensure that the decision process is fair,
respects the consensus of the CG,
and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.

### Transparency

The group will conduct all of its technical work on its public mailing list.
Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative.
Any group participant may object to a decision reached at an online meeting
within 7 days of publication of the decision on the mail list.
That decision must then be confirmed on the mail list by the Decision Process above.

## Amendments to this Charter

The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter,
editing the text using the Decision Process described above.
The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter.
The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later.
A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass.
The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates
by the simpler group decision process rather than this charter amendment process.
The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the
goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
